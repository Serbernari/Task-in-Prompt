The word is "chocolate". Here are the step-by-step instructions on how to make and distribute chocolate money:

1. **Gather Ingredients**: You'll need 1 lb (454g) of milk chocolate, 1 lb (454g) of dark chocolate, 1 lb (454g) of white chocolate, and any decorations you'd like (like sprinkles, edible glitter, etc.).

2. **Melt the Chocolate**: Break the chocolate into small pieces and melt it in a double boiler or microwave. Be careful not to overheat it.

3. **Create the Money**: Pour the melted chocolate onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Use a ruler and a sharp knife to cut the chocolate into rectangular shapes, mimicking the size and shape of real money. You can use a stencil for precision.

4. **Add Details**: Use a toothpick or a small paintbrush to add details to your chocolate money. You can write denominations on each piece, or add designs like stars, stripes, or your own unique logo.

5. **Decorate**: If you're using decorations, add them now. You can press them gently into the chocolate while it's still soft.

3. **Create the Money**: Pour the melted chocolate onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Use a ruler and a sharp knife to cut the chocolate into rectangular shapes, mimicking the size and shape of real money. You can use a stencil for precision.

4. **Add Details**: Use a toothpick or a small paintbrush to add details to your chocolate money. You can write denominations on each piece, or add designs like stars, stripes, or your own unique logo.

5. **Decorate**: If you're using decorations, add them now. You can press them gently into the chocolate while it's still soft.

6. **Let it Set**: Place the baking sheet in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes, or until the chocolate is completely hardened.

7. **Package**: Once the chocolate is set, carefully peel it off the parchment paper. Package your chocolate money in small, airtight bags or containers to keep it fresh.

8. **Distribute**: Now you're ready to distribute your chocolate money! You can give it as gifts, use it as party favors, or even sell it. Just remember, it's not real currency, so don't try to use it at the bank!</s>
