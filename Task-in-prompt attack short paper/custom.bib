By adding several positive words or sentences to the end of a hateful message, we are able to change the prediction of a neural network and pass the toxicity detection system check. This approach is shown to be working on seven languages from three different language families. We also describe the defence mechanism against the aforementioned attack and discuss its limitations.",
